                    <h2>Study Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        This task is part of a research study being conducted
                        by the Teachable AI Lab at Drexel University. The purpose of the research is
                        to better understand how best to structure the
                        interactions between a human and an Artificial
                        Intelligence (AI) system when either the human or the
                        AI is trying to teach the other something new. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Procedures</h2>
                    <p>
                        During this experiment, which we expect to take
                        approximately 30 minutes, you will be asked to either
                        teach an agent (AI system or another human) to perform a range of tasks or the
                        agent will assume the role of the teacher and try
                        and provide you with guidance on the same tasks. These
                        interactions will take place through a web-based
                        simulation environment and a web-based user interface.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Participant Requirements</h2>
                    <p>
                        Participation in this study is limited to individuals
                        <strong>age 18 and older</strong> and <strong>fluent in English</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Additionally, all participants are required to have a
                        <strong>modern web browser</strong>, such as Chrome,
                        Safari, Edge, or Firefox, with <strong>WebGl support
                        enabled</strong> (a requirement for using the web-based
                        simulation).
                    </p>

                    <h2>Risks</h2>
                    <p>
                        The risks and discomfort associated with participation
                        in this study are no greater than those ordinarily
                        encountered in daily life or during other online
                        activities.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Benefits</h2>
                    <p>
                        There may be no personal benefit from your
                        participation in the study but the knowledge received
                        may be of value to humanity.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Compensation and Costs</h2>
                    <p>
                        For participating in this task, you will be paid $3.625
                        directly through Mechanical Turk. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, there is an opportunity to receive a
                        bonus on this task based on your performance as either
                        a teacher or student. If you are randomly assigned the
                        role of a teacher, then your bonus will be based on the
                        performance of the <em>agent</em> you teach on a
                        pre-determined set of test tasks at the end of training
                        (the test score will vary from 0 to 100 percent).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, if you're randomly assigned the role of a
                        student, then your bonus will be based on <em>your</em>
                        performance on a pre-determined set of test tasks after
                        the agent provides you with training.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A maximum bounus of $2 will be awarded for a perfect
                        score on the test tasks and the bonus will be prorated
                        for scores less than 100% (i.e., bonus = $2 * test
                        score). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There will be no cost to you if you participate in this
                        study.
                    </p>
