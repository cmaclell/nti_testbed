        <h2>Role Overview</h2>
	    <p>
            Congratulations, you have been randomly assigned to the role of
            <em>teacher</em> for this experiment! Your job 
            will be to teach an AI system to perform a particular
            task, which will be described to you shortly.

            Before describing the task and training interface, this page is
            meant to give you a brief overview of the structure of the
            experiment. See the following figure for a depection of the three
            phases of the experiment.
        </p>

        <h2>Experimental Process</h2>

        <p>
            The following figure dipicts the steps you will go through for this
            experiment.

        </p>

        <p>
            You are currently on the "instructions" step.  Once you finish the
            instructions, you will then teach the AI student to perform the
            same task in the context of three scenarios. Finally, you will be
            asked to complete a questionaire regarding your teaching experience.
        </p>

        <h2>AI Student Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
            After you complete the experiment, we will test the AI student
            that you taught to see if it can complete the same task in three
            novel scenarios. The performance of the AI student on these test
            problems will determine your bonus, so make sure you do your best
            to teach it!
        </p>
