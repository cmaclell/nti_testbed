        <h2>Role Overview</h2>
	    <p>
            Congratulations, you have been randomly assigned to the role of
            <em>student</em> for this experiment! Your job 
            will be to learn from an AI system how to perform 
            a novel task.

            Before describing the task and training interface, this page is
            meant to give you a brief overview of the structure of the
            experiment. 
        </p>

        <h2>Experimental Process</h2>
        <p>
            See the following figure for a dipiction of the four stages of the
            experiment.

        </p>

        <p>
            You are currently on the "instructions" stage. Once you
            finish, the AI system will teach you to perform a task in the
            context of three scenarios. After you complete this training, then
            you will be tested on your knowledge in three novel scenarios. Your
            performance on these test scenarios will determine your bonus, so
            make sure to do your best to learn the task and perform it
            correctly. Finally, once you finish the test scenarios, you will
            complete a questionaire about your experience.
